A microcontroller is just a fancy word for a small computer -- and that's exactly what it is. The particular microcontroller we recommend is called an Arduino. It's great because it is open-sourced and low-cost. There is a huge community online with lots of example projects, forums and code samples, so you'll never get stuck without someone to help.

## What makes the Arduino special?
Although the Arudino is a computer (like your laptop, iPad or android phone), it's also very different. It's stripped down (there are no screens, keyboards speakers built in), and greatly simplified. It only runs one program at a time, but runs it very fast. One thing that the Arduino has that your other computers don't is phsical inputs and outputs that you can hook up to sensors and motors. This makes the arduino capable of being the brains of your robot!

## How do you work with the Arduino?
As you begin to tinker with your arduino, you'll realize that there is a cycle. It goes something like this:

### 1. Write a program
In the first step, you'll use the free Arduino IDE (Integrated Development Environment) to write an arduino program. The program could do anything, from blinking a light to controling your washing machine over wifi.

### 2. Upload the program to the arduino
In the second step, you'll plug in the arduino to your computer with a USB cable and use the Arduino IDE to upload the program to the arduino.

### 3. Run the program
After uploading, the program is now running on your arduino. The main part of the program (as you'll see) is just one loop that runs over and over again really fast. Now you get to check to see if the program does what you imagined it would do, or if it causes the robot to have a mind of it's own.  

### 4. Rince and repeat
After seeing how the robot behaved, you'll want to modify the program to fix any bugs you saw, or add a new feature.  So go back to step 1 and do it again!
