<!--
The CARL (Challenge Arkansas Robotics League) Bot group is an affordable opportunity for the encouragement of hobby robotics in an open and accessible environment that encourages community, exploration and friendly competition.

We meet once a month at the Arkansas Regional Innovation Hub on the third Wednesday at 6:30 pm to share and learn.
