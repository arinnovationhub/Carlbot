# Sensors
- - - 

Sensors are your robot's eyes, ears, and nose. They allow the robot to detect it's surroundings and make decisions based on what's happening in the physical world. There are many, many kinds of sensors, detecting almost any physical, measurable property of the world you can imagine: force, temperature, acceleration, light, and everything in between. On this page, we list a few popular sensors that are great to start off with, due to their low cost, ease of use and versatility. 

## Buttons and Switches

A button is perhpas one of the most basic kinds of sensor, just telling you if a circuit is open or closed. Of course, there is a great varity of form factors to fit in with the many projects you'll dream up

#### Where to Buy
* [Sparkfun](https://www.sparkfun.com/products/9190): A very basic button
* [Sparkfun](https://www.sparkfun.com/products/11310): A switch for your missle control panel

## Potentiometer

A potentiometer (sometimes called a variable resisitor) changes the resistence in a circuit. You can use the arduino to measure this resistance. One common form factor is a knob -- turn it all the way one direction to set the resistence very low and turn it the other way to increase the resistence. 

This sounds technical and complex, but you are probably already familiar with potentiometers in your day-to-day life. For example, a knob that you turn to dim the lights in your living room makes use of a potentiometer.
