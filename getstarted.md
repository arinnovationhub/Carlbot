# What is CARL?

CARL (Challenge Arkansas Robotics League) is a community for robotics hobbyists of all ages and skill levels to learn, teach, share projects and ideas and have fun. CARLBot is a low-cost robotics platform aimed at beginners with little or no experience. It's composed of off-the-shelf components that you can buy online, so there is no need buy a 'sanctioned' kit. One of the great things about using off-the-shelf components is that the kit can grow with your experience. Gotten past the first stage, and you want to try out a new sensor or new chasis? No problem! 

One of the central tenents of CARL is that there is no "right" way or one answer. Creativity, tinkering and open-endedness are encouraged. As such, CARLBot does not have an instruction manual telling you how to connect each wire or write every line of code. Instead we have a series of articles, tutorials and project ideas to help you level-up your skills.

# Getting Started

So you want to get started with CARL, but don't have any experience with arduino, robots, or coding? No problem. We have assembled the essential parts you'll need and steps to follow to get you up and binking, spinning, whirling and beeping in no time.
