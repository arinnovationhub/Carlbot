# Output components
- - -
If all your robot did was sense it's surroundings, it would be somewhat boring. Your robot would be a little like a hermit on a mountaintop, observing the world but not interacting with it. Output components enable your robot to accomplish a task in some way. 

## LED

A Light Emitting Diode (LED) will light up your robot. A diode is an electrical component that allows electricity to flow through it in onde direction only. You'll notice with most LEDs, that one end is slightly longer than the other. The long end (called the annode) is the side that should be hooked up to the positive side of your circuit. The short side (called the cathode) hooks up to the negative side.

Before you go plugging in an LED into your circuit, remember that you'll need a resistor too, or your LED will draw too much current and burn out!  More on this in the tutorials.

## Servo Motor

Motors are the thing that makes robots fun. While there are many types of motors, servos are the simplest to get started with because they are easy to control. There are two types of servos. With traditional servos, you control their position. In other words the program that your write on your arduino will cause the servo to spin to a certain position (for example, the three o'clock position). This kind is usful for opening and closing a claw, for example. 

The other kind of servos are continuous rotation servos. With this kind, your program controls the speed of rotation, rather than the position. Continuous rotation servos (in conjusnction with wheels) are useful for making your robot move.
