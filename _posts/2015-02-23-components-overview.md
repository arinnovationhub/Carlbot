# Components
- - - 

At it's most basic CARLBot consists of the following major components. 

1. A microcontroller is the brains of your robot, controlling other components.
2. Sensors detect the robot's surroundings and feed input to the microcontroller
3. Output components (like motors, lights and buzzers) enable your robot to preform some task
4. The chasis is the structural platform for your robot  
5. Tools and miscelaneous parts are (sometimes litterally) the glue that enable you to hook all the components up 

You won't necessarily need all of these components and tools to get started, but this will give you some basic ideas of what's useful
