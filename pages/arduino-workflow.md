### How do you work with the Arduino?
As you begin to tinker with your arduino, you'll realize that there is a cycle. It goes something like this:

1. **Write a program** - In the first step, you'll use the free Arduino IDE (Integrated Development Environment) to write an arduino program. The program could do anything, from blinking a light to controling your washing machine over wifi.

1. **Upload the program to the arduino** - In the second step, you'll plug in the arduino to your computer with a USB cable and use the Arduino IDE to upload the program to the arduino.

1. **Run the program** - After uploading, the program is now running on your arduino. The main part of the program (as you'll see) is just one loop that runs over and over again really fast. Now you get to check to see if the program does what you imagined it would do, or if it causes the robot to have a mind of it's own.  

1. **Rince and repeat** - After seeing how the robot behaved, you'll want to modify the program to fix any bugs you saw, or add a new feature.  So go back to step 1 and do it again!
