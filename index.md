Challenge Arkansas Robotics League (CARL) is a club for people of all ages who like to build robots. We meet at the Arkansas Regional Innovation Hub in North Little Rock, Arkansas. 

You've never built a robot before? Pefect! For beginners we offer the official CARLBot kit. It comes with everything you need to get started building an awsome robot. Along the way, you'll pick up knowledge of electrical engineering, circuits, programming, and design. It's fun, challenging, and fun. (Did we mention building robots is fun?)

This site describes how to get started with your CARLBot kit. But since CARLBot is based on the widely-used, open-source arduino microcontroller, much of it is applicable to kits and components outside of the CARLBot kit.
